# HunterCore Notes

HunterCore is an independent DivineMC-based server core with a bundled plugin layer, a preferences file, HunterTools runtime modules, and a small extension API.

## Build

Use the same Paperweight flow as DivineMC:

```bash
GIT_CONFIG_COUNT=1 \
GIT_CONFIG_KEY_0=url.git@github.com:.insteadOf \
GIT_CONFIG_VALUE_0=https://github.com/ \
./gradlew applyAllPatches createPaperclipJar --no-daemon
```

The final runnable jar is generated at:

```text
divinemc-server/build/libs/divinemc-paperclip-26.1.2.local-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

The `Build HunterCore` GitHub Actions workflow runs on `main`, pull requests targeting `main`, and manual dispatches. Release jars are built by the `Release HunterCore` workflow.

## Bundled Plugins

HunterCore installs bundled plugins before Paper scans the plugin directory. On first startup it writes:

```text
plugins/HunterCore/preferences.yml
```

That file can disable the entire installer, disable individual bundled plugins, stop automatic replacement of changed bundled jars, and toggle HunterTools runtime modules/commands.

Current first batch:

```text
ViaVersion 5.9.1
ViaBackwards 5.9.1
ViaRewind 4.1.1
BlueMap 5.20
Chunky 1.5.3
PlaceholderAPI 2.12.2
Vault 1.7.3
ProtocolLib 5.4.0
WorldEdit 7.4.3
WorldGuard 7.0.17
Multiverse-Core 5.7.0
LuckPerms 5.5.55
CoreProtect 23.2
HunterTPA builtin
HunterAuth builtin
HunterTools builtin
```

External plugins are prepared by:

```bash
scripts/prepare-bundled-plugins.sh
```

To add another external bundled plugin, extend that script with a download/build step and call `manifest_entry`. To add another built-in plugin, add a subproject under `huntercore-plugins/`, copy its jar into `META-INF/huntercore/bundled-plugins` from `build.gradle.kts`, and add a resource entry to `divinemc-server/src/main/resources/META-INF/huntercore/bundled-plugins.yml`.

`/about` is HunterCore-specific. `/huntercore system` prints JVM, OS, CPU, memory, uptime, player count, and plugin directory information.

HunterTools provides TPS actionbar/sidebar display plus essentials-style commands such as `/heal`, `/feed`, `/fly`, `/gm`, `/day`, `/night`, `/sun`, `/rain`, `/thunder`, `/broadcast`, `/clearchat`, `/speed`, `/spawn`, `/setspawn`, and `/back`.

`/fakeplayer` creates lightweight Mannequin-based fake players with placement commands for teleporting, moving to the sender, rotating, fixed poses, and info output. `/npc` creates managed Villager or Mannequin NPCs and shares the same placement/info commands where the entity type supports them. Both are persisted in `plugins/HunterCore/preferences.yml` and rebuilt on startup/reload.

These lightweight actors are not real `ServerPlayer` connections, so they do not occupy player slots, load chunks, or run Carpet-style continuous use/attack/jump/sneak actions. A closer Carpet-like fake player should be implemented as a separate real-player simulation module.

## Web Panel And Map

HunterTools includes a lightweight built-in web panel. It defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:8088/`; set `modules.web-panel.bind-address` to `0.0.0.0` and change `modules.web-panel.port` to expose it.

Guests can view public status, health alerts, and the configured BlueMap URL. Logged-in player users can view detailed player/plugin data and run only `modules.web-panel.player-allowed-commands` or their per-user `allowed-commands`; admin users can run console commands when `modules.web-panel.admin-command-execution` is enabled, and can also be restricted with per-user command lists. Admin users also get Actors, Operations, and Web Users panels for spawning/removing fake players and NPCs, toggling HunterTools modules and built-in module commands, and creating/updating/removing web users with player/admin roles, command execution toggles, and allowed-command lists. The web UI blocks deleting or demoting the last password-configured admin. The `web-panel` module is self-protected from web shutdown. Web commands capture command output when possible, capped by `modules.web-panel.command-output-lines` and `modules.web-panel.command-output-chars`. Logged-in POST requests require a session CSRF token by default.

Create web users from console or an op account:

```text
/hunteradmin web user admin admin <password>
/hunteradmin web user player player <password>
/hunteradmin web allow player list spawn
/hunteradmin web execution player on
```

BlueMap is bundled for the web map, and Chunky is bundled for chunk pre-generation/performance prep. BlueMap still requires the server owner to read and set `accept-download` in `plugins/BlueMap/core.conf` on first use because it downloads Mojang client resources for rendering.

PlaceholderAPI, Vault, ProtocolLib, WorldEdit, and WorldGuard are bundled as a common server foundation for placeholders, economy/permission bridging, packet/protocol extensions, map editing, and region protection. Each one can still be disabled under `bundled-plugins.plugins.<plugin-id>`.

## Optimizations

The first optimization batch is intentionally conservative:

```text
optimizations.bundled-plugin-parallel-install.enabled
optimizations.bundled-plugin-parallel-install.max-workers
optimizations.hunter-tools.async-rendering
optimizations.hunter-tools.async-save
optimizations.hunter-tools.player-cache
optimizations.hunter-tools.render-workers
optimizations.hunter-tools.actor-async-load
optimizations.hunter-tools.actor-batch-save
optimizations.hunter-tools.web-panel-workers
optimizations.cpu.enabled
optimizations.cpu.paper-worker-threads
optimizations.cpu.divine-worker-threads
optimizations.cpu.netty-io-threads
optimizations.cpu.common-pool-parallelism
```

Bundled plugin install work is parallelized across different jar files. HunterTools renders sidebar text, loads fake player/NPC definitions, serves the web panel, saves preferences, and requests GC off the main thread, then returns to the Bukkit main thread for player/server mutations. Public guest status responses are cached for 1 second by default with `modules.web-panel.status-cache-millis`. Web panel health alerts expose configurable thresholds for low TPS, high MSPT, heap pressure, per-world chunk/entity load, and disabled plugins.

HunterCore also applies CPU-aware startup defaults for Paper/DivineMC worker threads, Netty IO threads, and ForkJoin common pool parallelism. Existing JVM flags are preserved by default. The web panel exposes the same CPU, worker, Netty, ForkJoin, and HunterTools web worker settings for remote status checks.

## API

The API entrypoint is:

```java
org.huntercore.api.HunterCoreProvider.get()
```

Plugins can register future `/huntercore` subcommands with:

```java
HunterCoreProvider.get().registerCommandExtension(extension);
```

The extension interface is `org.huntercore.api.HunterCommandExtension`.
